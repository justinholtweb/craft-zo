/**
 * Failure alerts: tell somebody when the Zoho Books connection is in trouble, once, and again when
 * it is not.
 *
 * Ported from Erpy, the reference for the connector family (see its CLAUDE.md, "Failure alerts").
 * The Sync screen already knows everything that has gone wrong. What it cannot do is make a
 * merchant look at it. Three incidents are worth interrupting somebody for:
 *
 * - **Failures** — at least `alertFailureThreshold` orders, payments, refunds or customers failed
 *   to sync inside the window. Every one of those is an order that is not in the books.
 * - **Not reconciled** — a document synced inside the window whose Zoho total disagrees with
 *   Commerce's by more than `varianceTolerance`. The invoice exists; the books are wrong.
 * - **Authentication** — Zoho refused the refresh token, or answered a 401 after Zo had already
 *   refreshed. Nothing syncs until somebody reconnects, and Zoho will not say so twice.
 *
 * Each incident is a latch in `zo_alerts`, one row per incident type, unique in the database.
 * Opening it sends one alert; it stays open — and silent — however many checks see the same
 * trouble; clearing it sends one recovery. A send is claimed with a conditional update before it
 * goes out and released if it fails, so the queue and cron checking in the same minute cannot
 * both send, and a mail outage does not swallow the alert.
 *
 * Detection runs from three places: {@see afterSync()} at the end of every order sync (failures
 * and variance, no cron needed), {@see noteAuthFailure()}/{@see noteAuthSuccess()} from `Api` and
 * `Auth` (authentication, immediately), and {@see check()} from `zo/alerts/check` and
 * `zo/sync/retry` — the only paths that can notice an incident *clearing* when nothing is syncing.
 *
 * Bodies are redacted ({@see redact()}): an alert goes to a mailbox and a chat channel, both of
 * which outlive the credential they would otherwise quote.
